# LUX-reader
In this project, I use the MAX44009 sensor and ATmega32 to measure the lux value of the environment. This module can be used to build optical-based IoT modules.

The MAX44009 ambient light sensor features an I2C
digital output that is ideal for a number of portable applications
such as smartphones, notebooks, and industrial
sensors. At less than 1Î¼A operating current, it is the
lowest power ambient light sensor in the industry and
features an ultra-wide 22-bit dynamic range from 0.045
lux to 188,000 lux.

To compile the code, I use MicroC Pro environment.
